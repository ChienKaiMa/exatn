Rationale:
 (a) The execution space consists of one or more DAGs in which nodes
     represent tensor operations (tasks) and directed edges represent
     dependencies between the corresponding nodes (tensor operations).
     Each DAG is associated with a uniquely named TAProL scope such that
     all tensor operations submitted by the Client to the ExaTN numerical
     server are forwarded into the DAG associated with the TaProL scope
     in which the Client currently resides.
 (b) The DAG lifecycle:
     openScope(name): Opens a new TAProL scope and creates its associated empty DAG.
                      The .submit method can then be used to append new tensor
                      operations or whole tensor networks into the current DAG.
                      The actual execution of the submitted tensor operations
                      is asynchronous and may start any time after submission.
     pauseScope(): Completes the actual execution of all started tensor operations in the
                   current DAG and defers the execution of the rest of the DAG for later.
     resumeScope(name): Pauses the execution of the currently active DAG (if any) and
                        resumes the execution of a previously paused DAG, making it current.
     closeScope(): Completes all tensor operations in the current DAG and destroys it.
 (c) submit(TensorOperation): Submits a tensor operation for (generally deferred) execution.
     sync(TensorOperation): Tests for completion of a specific tensor operation.
     sync(tensor): Tests for completion of all submitted update operations on a given tensor.
 (d) Upon creation, the TensorRuntime object spawns an execution thread which will be executing tensor
     operations in the course of DAG traversal. The execution thread will be joined upon TensorRuntime
     destruction. After spawning the execution thread, the main thread returns control to the client
     which will then be able to submit new operations into the current DAG. The submitted operations
     will be autonomously executed by the execution thread. The DAG execution policy is specified by
     a polymorphic TensorGraphExecutor provided during the construction of the TensorRuntime.
     Correspondingly, the TensorGraphExecutor contains a polymorphic TensorNodeExecutor responsible
     for the actual execution of submitted tensor operations via an associated computational backend.
     The concrete TensorNodeExecutor is specified during the construction of the TensorRuntime oject.
 (e) DEVELOPERS ONLY: The TensorGraph object (DAG) provides lock/unlock methods for concurrent update
     of the DAG structure (by Client thread) and its execution state (by Execution thread).
     Additionally each node of the TensorGraph (TensorOpNode object) provides more fine grain
     locking mechanism (lock/unlock methods) for providing exclusive access to individual DAG nodes.
