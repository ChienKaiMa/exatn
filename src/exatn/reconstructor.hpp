/** Rationale:
 (A) Given a tensor network expansion of some form, the tensor network reconstructor
     optimizes its tensor factors to maximize the overlap with another given constant
     tensor network expansion, thus providing an approximation to it. The reconstruction
     fidelity is the normalized squared overlap between the two tensor network expansions.
     The reconstruction tolerance is a numerical tolerance used for checking convergence
     of the underlying linear algebra procedures.
 (B) The reconstructed tensor network expansion must be a Ket (primary space) and
     the reconstructing tensor network expansion must be a Bra (dual space).
